# HACKTOBER FEST COMMUNITY 2020

This project is to teach you programmers how to write better quality code which is not written by the programmers working at the companies. We accept the codes that not suck.

## CONCEPT

Basically the concept of the project to rate the better quality amongst others. In this project the programmers can randomly rate the code of some other guys which is unknown and you can view your code quality rating which you got. For rating we are working on a website which you will get this October before the Hacktober Fest Ends.

## CODEBASE

This is a community project so we need a support from you guys for having the better quality code snippets of some problem. Please refer to [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### HACKTOBER FEST 20

As a part of the contest send us better quality code in any language written by you only. For more details please refer to [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
