# :male_detective: codemash

It is a fun project to teach programmers how to write better code by reviewing the bad-quality code contributed by any random programmer.

## Motivation

If you work as a software engineer, maybe you have seen bad quality code that is working, but it has a lot of bugs, and debugging the whole codebase is difficult. That's why the main motivation is to spread awareness among open-source programmers.

## Concept

The concept of the project is to rate the code quality of the codes contributed to this repository in the CodeBase folder.

You can also check your code quality score by searching your GitHub username on the leaderboard. We accept the codes that don't suck at their quality.
